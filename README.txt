This is a simple tic-tac-toe program.  Learning programming from 
'Jumping Into C++' by Alex Allain there is a repeated idea of 
learning new topics by writing code for a tic-tac-toe game.  This
is just my most updated version of the code worked on throughout
reading the book.

The data and methods needed for writing a game loop are put into 
a class called tictactoe and two simple game modes of a standard
two player game and a single player game against an AI picking
squares at random were included.

I'm fairly sure this could be easily modified to have variable
sized boards, some work has already gone into this.
